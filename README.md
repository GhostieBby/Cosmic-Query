# *Cosmic Query*

*Description*

*Timeframe & Working Team (Solo/Pair/Group)*
---

We were tasked with creating a React App by ourselves or with a partner that could be deployed and accessed by the public. Each of us have had a keen interest in the cosmos, so picking the API we wanted to use was a piece of cake.

___
*Technologies Used*
---
For this project I used only JavaScript, SCSS, React, and Bootstrap.

*Brief*

*Technical Requirements*

Your app must:
* **Consume a public API** – this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
* **Have several components**
* **The app can have a router** - with several "pages", this is up to you and if it makes sense for your project.
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public (hosted on your public github, not GA github!)

## Necessary Deliverables
​
* A **working application**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
* **A `readme.md` file** with:
  * Explanations of the **technologies** used
    * A couple of paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    * Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
   * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to overcome

*Planning*
---
For this project, my partner created the wireframe and I began writing some pseudocode and creating the foundation of the project. It was great being able to bounce ideas back and forth and discuss what we wanted to do, what methods we'd use to implement those things, and so on. By the time we finished up for the day, we had the vast majority of the project completed.

___
*Build/Code Process*
---
Being able to work alongside someone else made the entire process much easier. Normally if I get stuck somewhere, I'll take a break to clear my head then come back to it. The consistent dialogue made it much easier to stay on track with multiple things at once.

*Challenges*
---

Getting each of the components to interact correctly with one another was the first issue we ran into. This bogged us down for at least an hour, but it was a lot of fun because each of us had entirely different solutions to this.

There were countless times that one of us would hit a roadblock and the other would chime in with a quick, one-line-of-code solution. It was a relief being able to get past my roadblocks, and exciting when I was able to helm him past his. We each had a huge laugh when an issue that had taken a full hour to address was resolved with just two words.

The biggest issue we had was actually related to Github collaboration. We both knew the fundamentals of working on a project by yourself, but collaboration brought on many things we'd never dealt with. Once we had finally gotten everything resolved, we couldn't help but celebrate as if we'd won a jackpot.
